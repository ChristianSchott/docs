# Bullet Info

The `Bullet Info` object allows setting physical information about the bullet fired by a weapon, which layers the bullet is able to hit, and a bullet specific `Impact Handler` object.

Create a new `Bullet Info` object under `Assets/Create/Ballistics/Bullet Info`.

For additional information about the `Bullet Info` object fields, please refer to the inspector tooltips.
